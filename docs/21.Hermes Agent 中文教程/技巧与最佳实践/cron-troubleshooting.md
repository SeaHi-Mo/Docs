# Cron Troubleshooting

When a cron job isn't behaving as expected, work through these checks in order. Most issues fall into one of four categories: timing, delivery, permissions, or skill loading.

---

## Jobs Not Firing

### Check 1: Verify the job exists and is active

```bash
hermes cron list
```

Look for the job and confirm its state is `[active]` (not `[paused]` or `[completed]`). If it shows `[completed]`, the repeat count may be exhausted — edit the job to reset it.

### Check 2: Confirm the schedule is correct

A misformatted schedule silently defaults to one-shot or is rejected entirely. Test your expression:

| Your expression | Should evaluate to |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `0 9 * * *` | 9:00 AM every day |
| `0 9 * * 1` | 9:00 AM every Monday |
| `every 2h` | Every 2 hours from now |
| `30m` | 30 minutes from now |
| `2025-06-01T09:00:00` | June 1, 2025 at 9:00 AM UTC |

If the job fires once and then disappears from the list, it's a one-shot schedule (`30m`, `1d`, or an ISO timestamp) — expected behavior.

### Check 3: Is the gateway running?

Cron jobs are fired by the gateway's background ticker thread, which ticks every 60 seconds. A regular CLI chat session does **not** automatically fire cron jobs.

If you're expecting jobs to fire automatically, you need a running gateway (`hermes gateway` or `hermes serve`). For one-off debugging, you can manually trigger a tick with `hermes cron tick`.

### Check 4: Check the system clock and timezone

Jobs use the local timezone. If your machine's clock is wrong or in a different timezone than expected, jobs will fire at the wrong times. Verify:

```bash
date
hermes cron list   # Compare next_run times with local time
```

## Delivery Failures

### Check 1: Verify the deliver target is correct

Delivery targets are case-sensitive and require the correct platform to be configured. A misconfigured target silently drops the response.

| Target | Requires |
|--------|----------|
| `telegra...
