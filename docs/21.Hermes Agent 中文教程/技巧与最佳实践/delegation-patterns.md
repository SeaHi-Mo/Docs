# Delegation & Parallel Work

Hermes can spawn isolated child agents to work on tasks in parallel. Each subagent gets its own conversation, terminal session, and toolset. Only the final summary comes back — intermediate tool calls never enter your context window.

For the full feature reference, see [Subagent Delegation](/docs/user-guide/features/delegation).

## When to Delegate

**Good candidates for delegation:**
- Reasoning-heavy subtasks (debugging, code review, research synthesis)
- Tasks that would flood your context with intermediate data
- Parallel independent workstreams (research A and B simultaneously)
- Fresh-context tasks where you want the agent to approach without bias

**Use something else:**
- Single tool call → just use the tool directly
- Mechanical multi-step work with logic between steps → `execute_code`
- Tasks needing user interaction → subagents can't use `clarify`
- Quick file edits → do them directly

## Pattern: Parallel Research

Research three topics simultaneously and get structured summaries back:

```
Research these three topics in parallel:
1. Current state of WebAssembly outside the browser
2. RISC-V server chip adoption in 2025
3. Practical quantum computing applications

Focus on recent developments and key players.
```

Behind the scenes, Hermes uses:

```python
delegate_task(tasks=[
    {
        "goal": "Research WebAssembly outside the browser in 2025",
        "context": "Focus on: runtimes (Wasmtime, Wasmer), cloud/edge use cases, WASI progress",
        "toolsets": ["web"]
    },
    {
        "goal": "Research RISC-V server chip adoption",
        "context": "Focus on: server chips shipping, cloud providers adopting, software ecosystem",
        "toolsets": ["web"]
    },
    {
        "goal": "Research practical quantum computing applications",
        "context": "Focus on: error correction breakthroughs, real-world use cases, key companies",
        "toolsets": ["web"]
    }
])
```

All three run concurrentl...
